        <h1>My Train Bloge</h1>
        <p>It was almost midnight when Rafiq reached the small, dimly lit station. The platform was nearly empty, just a few stray dogs and the echo of crickets in the night. The timetable on the wall said the last train had left fifteen minutes ago, but he sat down anyway.He had run away from home after a bitter argument with his father. His chest still burned with anger, but beneath it all was a weight of regret.</p>
